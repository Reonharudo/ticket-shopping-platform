## First Steps

Navigate to the root folder of the project and execute `npm install`. Based on the _package.json_ file, npm will download all required node_modules to run an Angular application.
Afterwards, execute `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install the Angular CLI globally.

## Development

### Development server

Run `ng serve` to start the web application. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
